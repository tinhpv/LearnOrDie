# Data Race - Race Condition ü§îüÜò

Data Race and Race Condition are **DIFFERENT**
- *Data-Race* ‚Üí MORE than 1 thread access to shared-resource (can be a variable or object) and AT LEAST 1 thread tries to **modify** that resource
- *Race-Condition* ‚Üí **Order** of threads' execution leads to wrong program behavior
- Many race conditions are due to data races, and many data races lead to race conditions. Can have race conditions without data races and data races without race conditions.

Example:
 ```swift
 func transfer(amount: Int, from source: BankAccount, to destination: BankAccount) -> Bool {
    if source.balance >= amount {
        destination.balance += amount
        source.balance -= amount
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```
üîµ **LET'S RUN ON ONE-SINGLE THREAD**
```swift
let firstBank = BankAccount(balance: 100)
let secondBank = BankAccount(balance: 100)
transfer(amount: 50, from: firstBank, to: secondBank)

print(firstBank.balance) // 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£
print(secondBank.balance) // 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è
 ```
 It makes sense! ‚úÖ
 
üî¥ **LET'S RUN ON MULTIPLE THREADS**
```swift
let firstBank = BankAccount(balance: 100)
let secondBank = BankAccount(balance: 100)
transfer(amount: 50, from: firstBank, to: secondBank) // run on thread (1)
transfer(amount: 70, from: firstBank, to: secondBank) // run on thread (2)

// if (1) goes first
print(firstBank.balance) // 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£
print(secondBank.balance) // 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è

// but if (2) goes first
print(firstBank.balance) // 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£
print(secondBank.balance) // 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è
```
- ONLY mention about the ORDER of execution, (1) goes first or (2) goes first lead to 2 different outcomes
- IN REALITY, while (1) is checking the condition and execute `destination.balance += amount` (we suppose), thread (2) is also going through these steps and unexpectedly modify the same data ‚Üí the outcome is unpredictable and can even cause crash üò´
